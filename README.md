# MagicSystem

MagicSystem is a Bukkit plugin that adds a magic system to Minecraft. Hugely inspired by The Elder Scrolls games as well as the Warcraft franchise, SoulsBourne games and other high fantasy universes. The spells come in the form of spell tomes scrolls, and staffs (yes, pluralized with double-f).
